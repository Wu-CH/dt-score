DT-Score (Delaunay Triangulation-Score)

## Introduction

DT-Score (Delaunay Triangulation-Score), aims to maximize the coverage of a given sensing area with obstacles. 
The DT-Score consists of two phases. In the first phase, we use a contour-based deployment to eliminate the coverage holes near the boundary of sensing area and obstacles. 
In the second phase, a deployment method based on the Delaunay Triangulation is applied for the uncovered regions.

## Build

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Wu-CH/dt-score.git
cd dt-score/source
make clean
make all
```

## Usage

- deployment

```sh
cd dt-score/test
../source/DT-Score/dt-score case_1_600
```

- calculage coverage

```sh
cd dt-score/test
../source/coverage/coverage case_1_600_result_DT-Score
```
