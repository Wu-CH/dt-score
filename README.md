DT-Score (Delaunay Triangulation-Score)

## Introduction

DT-Score (Delaunay Triangulation-Score), aims to maximize the coverage of a given sensing area with obstacles. 
The DT-Score consists of two phases. In the first phase, we use a contour-based deployment to eliminate the coverage holes near the boundary of sensing area and obstacles. 
In the second phase, a deployment method based on the Delaunay Triangulation is applied for the uncovered regions.
